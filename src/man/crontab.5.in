.TH CRONTAB 5 "03 July 2014" "@package@ @version@" "crontab"
.UC 4
.SH NAME
crontab \- tables for driving @package@
.SH DESCRIPTION
A
.I crontab
file contains instructions to
.IR @package@
of the general form: ``run this command at this time on this date''.
Each user has their own crontab, and commands in any given crontab will be
executed as the user who owns the crontab.
.PP
Blank lines and leading spaces and tabs are ignored.  Lines whose first
non-space character is a hash-sign (#) are comments, and are ignored.
Note that comments are not allowed on the same line as cron commands, since
they will be taken to be part of the command.  Similarly, comments are not
allowed on the same line as environment variable settings.
.PP
An active line in a crontab will be either an environment setting or a cron
command.  The crontab file is parsed from top to bottom, so any environment
settings will affect only the cron commands below them in the file.
An environment setting is of the form,
.PP
    name = value
.PP
where the spaces around the equal-sign (=) are optional, and any subsequent
non-leading spaces in
.I value
will be part of the value assigned to
.IR name .
The
.I value
string may be placed in quotes (single or double, but matching) to preserve
leading or trailing blanks. The
.I value
string is
.B not
parsed for environmental substitutions or replacement of variables, thus lines
like
.PP
    PATH = $HOME/bin:$PATH
.PP
will not work as you might expect. And neither will this work
.PP
    A=1
    B=2
    C=$A $B
.PP
There will not be any subsitution for the defined variables in the
last value.
.PP
An alternative for setting up the commands path is using the fact that
many shells will treat the tilde(~) as substitution of $HOME, so if you use
.I bash
for your tasks you can use this:
.PP
     SHELL=/bin/bash
     PATH=~/bin:/usr/bin/:/bin
.PP

.I Special variables:
.TP
.B SHELL, PATH, USER, LOGNAME, HOME, LANG
Those are set up automatically by systemd itself, see
.IR systemd.exec (5)
SHELL defaults to /bin/sh.
SHELL and PATH may be overridden by settings in the crontab.

.TP
.B MAILTO
.br
On error
.IR systemd.cron (7)
will look at MAILTO. If MAILTO is defined mail is sent to this email address.
MAILTO may also be used to direct mail to multiple
recipients by separating recipient users with a comma.
If MAILTO is defined but empty (MAILTO=""), no mail will be sent.
Otherwise mail is sent to the owner of the crontab.
.br
This mail only contains an small excerpt from the log, as seen when using
.B systemctl status
The full output remains avaible in the journal.

.TP
.B RANDOM_DELAY
(in minutes) environment variable is translated to
.B AccuracySec=.

.TP
.B START_HOURS_RANGE
(in hours) environment variable is translated to the
.I \'hour\'
component of
.B OnCalendar=.
This variable is inheritted from anacrontab(5), but also supported in crontab(5)
by systemd-crontab-generator. Anacron expect a time range in the START-END format (eg: 6-9),
systemd-crontab-generator will only use the starting hour of the range as reference.
Unless you set this variable, all the @daily/@weekly/@monthly/@yearly jobs
will run at midnight. If you set this variable and the system was off during
the ours defined in the range, the (persitent) job will start at boot.

.PP
The format of a
.B cron command
is the same as the one defined by the cron daemon.
Each line has five time and date fields,
followed by a command, followed by a newline character ('\\n').
The system crontab (/etc/crontab) and the packages crontabs (/etc/cron.d/*)
use the same format, except that the username for the command is specified after the time and
date fields and before the command. The fields may be separated
by spaces or tabs.
.PP
Commands are executed by
.IR systemd
when the minute, hour, and month of year fields match the current time,
.I and
when at least one of the two day fields (day of month, or day of week)
match the current time (see ``Note'' below).
The time and date fields are:
.IP
.ta 1.5i
field	allowed values
.br
-----	--------------
.br
minute	0-59
.br
hour	0-23
.br
day of month	1-31
.br
month	1-12 (or names, see below)
.br
day of week	0-7 (0 or 7 is Sun, or use names)
.br
.PP
A field may be an asterisk (*), which always stands for ``first\-last''.
.PP
Ranges of numbers are allowed.  Ranges are two numbers separated
with a hyphen.  The specified range is inclusive.  For example,
8-11 for an ``hours'' entry specifies execution at hours 8, 9, 10
and 11.
.PP
Lists are allowed.  A list is a set of numbers (or ranges)
separated by commas.  Examples: ``1,2,5,9'', ``0-4,8-12''.
.PP
Step values can be used in conjunction with ranges.  Following
a range with ``/<number>'' specifies skips of the number's value
through the range.  For example, ``0-23/2'' can be used in the hours
field to specify command execution every other hour (the alternative
in the V7 standard is ``0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22'').  Steps are
also permitted after an asterisk, so if you want to say ``every two
hours'', just use ``*/2''.
.PP
Names can also be used for the ``month'' and ``day of week''
fields.  Use the first three letters of the particular
day or month (case doesn't matter).  Ranges or
lists of names are not allowed.
.PP
The ``sixth'' field (the rest of the line) specifies the command to be
run.
The entire command portion of the line, up to a newline
.\" or % character
, will be executed by /bin/sh or by the shell
specified in the SHELL variable of the crontab file.
.\"Percent-signs (%) in the command, unless escaped with backslash
.\"(\\), will be changed into newline characters, and all data
.\"after the first % will be sent to the command as standard
.\"input. There is no way to split a single command line onto multiple
.\"lines, like the shell's trailing "\\".
.PP
systemd-crontab-generator doesn't handle multi-line command split by
the % character like vixie-cron.
.PP
Note: The day of a command's execution can be specified by two
fields \(em day of month, and day of week.  If both fields are
restricted (i.e., aren't *), the command will be run when
.I either
field matches the current time.  For example,
.br
``30 4 1,15 * 5''
would cause a command to be run at 4:30 am on the 1st and 15th of each
month, plus every Friday. One can, however, achieve the desired result
by adding a test to the command (see the last example in EXAMPLE CRON FILE
below).
.PP
Instead of the first five fields, one of eight special strings may appear:
.IP
.ta 1.5i
string	meaning
.br
------	-------
.br
@reboot	Run once, at startup.
.br
@yearly	Run once a year, "0 0 1 1 *".
.br
@annually	(same as @yearly)
.br
@monthly	Run once a month, "0 0 1 * *".
.br
@weekly	Run once a week, "0 0 * * 0".
.br
@daily	Run once a day, "0 0 * * *".
.br
@midnight	(same as @daily)
.br
@hourly	Run once an hour, "0 * * * *".
.br
.PP
Please note that startup, as far as @reboot is concerned,
may be before some system daemons,
or other facilities, were startup.  This is due to the boot order
sequence of the machine.

.SH EXAMPLE CRON FILE

The following lists an example of a user crontab file.

.nf

# use /bin/bash to run commands, instead of the default /bin/sh
SHELL=/bin/bash
# mail errors to `paul', no matter whose crontab this is
MAILTO=paul
#
# run five minutes after midnight, every day
5 0 * * *       $HOME/bin/daily.job >> $HOME/tmp/out 2>&1
# run at 2:15pm on the first of every month
.\" -- output mailed to paul
15 14 1 * *     $HOME/bin/monthly
.\"# run at 10 pm on weekdays, annoy Joe
.\"0 22 * * 1-5    mail \-s "It's 10pm" joe%Joe,%%Where are your kids?%
23 0-23/2 * * * echo "run 23 minutes after midn, 2am, 4am ..., everyday"
5 4 * * sun     echo "run at 5 after 4 every sunday"
# Run on every second Saturday of the month
0 4 8-14 * *    test $(date +\\%u) \-eq 6 && echo "2nd Saturday"
.fi
.SH EXAMPLE SYSTEM CRON FILE

The following lists the content of a regular system-wide crontab file. Unlike a
user's crontab, this file has the username field, as used by /etc/crontab.

.nf
# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
# Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
# command to install the new version when you edit this file
# and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,
# that none of the other crontabs do.

SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

# m h dom mon dow user	command
17 * * * *  root  cd / && run-parts \-\-report /etc/cron.hourly
25 6 * * *  root  test \-x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts \-\-report /etc/cron.daily )
47 6 * * 7  root  test \-x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts \-\-report /etc/cron.weekly )
52 6 1 * *  root  test \-x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts \-\-report /etc/cron.monthly )
#
.fi

.PP
This is only an example,
.B systemd-cron uses native units instead for those jobs.
.br
If you add those lines, your jobs will run twice.

.SH SEE ALSO
systemd.cron(7), systemd-crontab-generator(8), crontab(1)

.SH LIMITATIONS
The
.I systemd-cron
units runs with a defined timezone. It currently does not support
per-user timezones. All the tasks: system's and user's will be run based on the
configured timezone. Even if a user specifies the
.I TZ
environment variable in his
.I crontab
this will affect only the commands executed in the crontab, not the execution
of the crontab tasks themselves.

The
.I crontab
syntax does not make it possible to define all possible periods one could
image off. For example, it is not straightforward to define the last
weekday of a month. If a task needs to be run in a specific period of time
that cannot be defined in the
.I crontab
syntaxs the best approach would be to have the program itself check the
date and time information and continue execution only if the period
matches the desired one.

.B systemd-crontab-generator
doesn't support these
.B vixie-cron
features:
.TP
*
spawning forking deamons, the 'Service' units are all set with 'Type=oneshot'
.TP
*
multi-line jobs separated by the '%' character
.TP
*
vixie-cron requires that each entry in a crontab end in a newline character. If the
last entry in a crontab is missing a newline (ie, terminated by EOF), vixie-cron will
consider the crontab (at least partially) broken.
.br
systemd-crontab-generator considers this crontab as valid

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
You can see how your crontab where translated by typing:
.br
.B systemctl cat cron-<userid>-*
.PP
.B systemctl cat
does support command-line completion.
