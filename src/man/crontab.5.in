.Sh NAME
.Nm crontab
.Nd tables for driving systemd-cron
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
A
.Nm
file contains instructions for
.Nm systemd-cron
of the general form
.Qq run this command at this time on this date .
Each user has their own
.Nm ,
and commands in any given
.Nm
will be executed as the user who owns it.
.Pp
Blank lines and leading spaces and tabs are ignored.
Lines whose first non-space character is a hash
.Pq Sq Sy #
are comments, and are ignored.
Note that comments are not allowed on the same line as cron commands, since
they will be taken to be part of the command.
Similarly, comments are not
allowed on the same line as environment variable settings.
.Pp
An active line in a
.Nm
will be either an environment setting or a cron command.
The
.Nm
file is parsed from top to bottom, so any environment
settings will affect only the cron commands below them in the file.
An environment setting takes the form
.Dl Va name Li = Va value
where the white-space around the equals sign
.Pq Sq Sy =
is optional,
and any subsequent non-leading non-trailing white-space will be part of the value assigned to
.Va name .
.Va value
may be placed in matching quotes
.Pq So Sy ' Sc or Sq Sy \&" ,
to preserve embedded leading or trailing white-space.
The
.Va value
string is
.Em not
parsed for environmental substitutions or replacement of variables, thus lines
like
.Dl PATH = $HOME/bin:$PATH
will not work as you might expect.
And neither will this work:
.Bd -literal -compact -offset indent
A=1
B=2
C=$A $B
.Ed
There will not be any substitution for the defined variables in the last value
.Pq i.e., Va C No will be Qo Li $A $B Qc , not Qq Li 1 2 .
.Pp
In
.Sy PATH ,
tilde-expansion is performed on elements starting with
.Qq Sy ~/ ,
so this works as expected:
.Bd -literal -compact -offset indent
SHELL=/bin/bash
PATH=~/bin:/usr/bin/:/bin
.Ed
.
.Ss Special variables
.Bl -tag
.It Sy SHELL , PATH , USER , LOGNAME , HOME , LANG
Those are set up automatically by systemd, see
.Xr systemd.exec 5 .
.Sy SHELL
defaults to
.Pa /bin/sh .
.Sy SHELL
and
.Sy PATH
may be overridden by settings in the
.Nm .
.
.It Sy MAILTO
When sending output from a job,
.Xr systemd.cron 7
will look at
.Sy MAILTO :
if defined, mail is sent to this email address.
.Sy MAILTO
may also be used to direct mail to multiple
recipients by separating recipient users with a comma
.Pq Sq Sy ,\& .
If
.Sy MAILTO
is set but empty
.Pq Li MAILTO="" , MAILTO= ,
no mail will be sent.
Otherwise mail is sent to the
.Nm Ns 's
owner.
.br
By default, this mail contains
.Nm systemctl Cm status
and the full log for the failed run, copied from the journal.
.
.It Sy MAILFROM
When sending output from a job,
.Xr systemd.cron 7
will look at
.Sy MAILFROM :
if defined, mail is sent from this email address.
Otherwise it's seen as being sent by "root".
.
.It Sy CRON_MAIL_SUCCESS
Control if (when) to send mail with output from successful jobs.
.Bl -tag -compact -width ".Sy always, yes, true, 1"
.It Sy nonempty , non-empty Ns \z:
mail is only sent if the job left anything in the journal
(i.e. wrote something to the standard output or error streams);
this is the default, and matches classic cron
.It Sy always , yes , true , 1 Ns \z:
always send mail
.It Sy never , no , false , 0 Ns \z:
never send mail for a successful job
.El
.Pp
Mail is
.Em always
sent for failed jobs.
.
.It Sy CRON_MAIL_FORMAT
Control the format of the content of cron-job-related messages.
.Bl -tag -compact -width ".Sy nometadata , no-metadata"
.It Sy normal Ns \z:
.Nm systemctl Cm status
+
.Nm journalctl
output (incl. time, process names, the usual) for the run;
this is the default
.It Sy nometadata , no-metadata Ns \z:
raw journal contents
.Pq Fl o Cm cat : No just standard output + error streams ;
this matches classic cron
.El
.Pp
.Sy CRON_MAIL_SUCCESS
and
.Sy CRON_MAIL_FORMAT ,
if changed in
.Pa /etc/crontab ,
are remembered for all other crontabs
.Pq Pa /etc/cron.d ,  /etc/anacron , No users' crontabs
and act as an administrator-controlled default.
They can be set to
.Sy inherit
to get that default back.
.
.It Sy CRON_INHERIT_VARIABLES
In the top-level
.Pa /etc/crontab :
a white-space-separated list of variables
.Pq Em including No control statements that get removed from the environment otherwise
to remember into other crontabs
.Pq Pa /etc/cron.d , No users' crontabs ; not Pa /etc/anacron .
This allows instituting a global
.Sy RANDOM_DELAY Ns / Ns Sy SHELL Ns /&c.\&
default policy.
.br
Elsewhere: ignored.
.
.It Sy RANDOM_DELAY
(in minutes) environment variable translated to
.Sy RandomizedDelaySec= .
.
.It Sy DELAY
(in minutes) environment variable translated to
.Sy OnBootSec= .
This works like the
.Xr anacrontab 5
.Va delay
and makes systemd wait the given amount of minutes
after boot before starting the unit.
This value can also be used to spread out
the start times of
.Sy @daily Ns / Ns Sy @weekly Ns / Ns Sy @monthly Ns /&c.\&
jobs on an always-on system.
.
.It Sy START_HOURS_RANGE
(in hours) environment variable translated to the
.Va hour
component of
.Sy OnCalendar= .
This variable is inherited from
.Xr anacrontab 5 ,
but also supported in
.Xr crontab 5 Ns s
by
.Xr systemd-crontab-generator 8 .
.Xr anacron 8
expects a time range like
.Qq Va start Ns - Ns Va end ,
but
.Xr systemd-crontab-generator 8
only uses the starting hour of the range as reference.
Unless you set this variable, all
.Sy @daily Ns / Ns Sy @weekly Ns / Ns Sy @monthly Ns /&c.\&
jobs will run at midnight.
If you do set this variable and the system was off during
the hours defined in the range, persistent jobs will start at boot.
.
.It Sy PERSISTENT
This boolean flag can override the generator's default heuristic:
.Bl -tag -compact -offset 2n -width ".Sy auto"
.It Sy yes Ns \z:
force all further jobs to be persistent
.It Sy auto Ns \z:
only recognize
.Sy @
keywords to be persistent
(this is the default)
.It Sy no Ns \z:
force all further jobs to not be persistent
.El
.
.It Sy TZ , CRON_TZ
The job is scheduled in this time-zone instead of in the system time-zone.
Must be a full IANA time-zone name
.Pq as found under Pa /usr/share/zoneinfo ,
or empty to reset to the default timezone;
otherwise no special semantics.
Always passed to the job.
.
.It Sy BATCH
This boolean flag is translated to options
.Sy CPUSchedulingPolicy=idle
and
.Sy IOSchedulingClass=idle
when set.
.
.It Sy CRON_BATCH_LOADAVG_BELOW
If set and nonempty, delay starting the job until the 1-minute system load average drops below the set value.
All jobs using this option join a global queue scheduling a random eligible job every at-least-30 seconds.
.
.It Sy CRON_BATCH_THROTTLE_GROUP
If set and nonempty, all jobs with the same value form a group where
no two jobs can run concurrently
and no job is started within 5 minutes of another exiting.
.br
If combined with
.Sy CRON_BATCH_LOADAVG_BELOW ,
the job joins its
.Sy CRON_BATCH_THROTTLE_GROUP
queue only, but the load threshold still applies.
.br
See
.Sx EXAMPLES , CRON_BATCH_â€¦ .
.El
.
.Ss The format of a cron command
is the same as the one defined by the classic cron daemon.
Each line has five time and date fields,
followed by a command, followed by a new-line character.
The system crontab
.Pq Pa /etc/crontab
and the packages' crontabs
.Pq Pa /etc/cron.d/ Ns Va *
use the same format, except that the username for the command is specified between the time/date fields and the command.
Fields may be separated by spaces or tabs.
.Pp
Commands are executed by
.Xr systemd 1
when the minute, hour, and month-of-year fields match the current time,
.Em and
when at least one of the two day fields (day-of-month or day-of-week)
match the current time
.Pq see Sx Note No below .
The time and date fields are:
.TS
lw5 l l .
	field	allowed values
	_	_
	minute	0-59
	hour	0-23
	day-of-month	1-31
	month	1-12 (or names, see below)
	day-of-week	0-7 (Sun is 0 or 7, or use names)
.TE
.Pp
A field may be an asterisk
.Pq Sq Sy * ,
which always stands for
.Qq Va first Ns - Ns Va last .
.Pp
Ranges of numbers are allowed.
Ranges are two numbers separated with a hyphen
.Pq Sq Sy - .
The specified range is inclusive.
For example,
.Sy 8-11
for an
.Va hours
entry specifies execution at hours
.Sy 8 , 9 , 10 , No and Sy 11 .
.Pp
A random value (within the legal range) may be obtained by using the tilde
.Pq Sq Sy ~
character instead of the hyphen.
The interval of the random value may be specified explicitly, for example
.Sy 0~30
will result in a random value between
.Sy 0 No and Sy 30 ,
inclusive.
If either (or both) of the numbers on the sides of the
.Sq Sy ~
are omitted, the appropriate limit (low or high) for the field will be used.
.Pp
Lists are allowed.
A list is a set of numbers (or ranges) separated by commas.
Examples:
.Sy 1,2,5,9 , 0-4,8-12 .
.Pp
Step values can be used in conjunction with ranges.
Following a range with
.Qq Sy / Ns Va number
specifies skips of
.Va number Ns 's
value through the range.
For example,
.Sy 0-23/2
can be used in the hours field to specify command execution every other hour
.Pq the alternative in At v7 standard form is Sy 0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22 .
Steps are also permitted after an asterisk, so if you want to say
"every two hours", just use
.Sy */2 .
.Pp
Names can also be used for the
.Va month
and
.Va day-of-week
fields.
Use at least the first three letters of the particular
day or month (case doesn't matter).
Ranges or lists of names are not allowed.
.Pp
The rest of the line, after the fields, specifies the command to be run.
The entire command portion of the line
will be executed by
.Pa /bin/sh
or by the shell specified in the
.Sy SHELL
variable of the
.Nm
file.
.Pp
If the command contains an unescaped percent
.Pq Sq Sy %
character,
it is instead split thereon:
the part before is run by the shell,
the part after is given on the standard input stream, with each subsequent
.Sy %
replaced by a new-line.
.Sy % Ns s
can be escaped as
.Qq Sy \e% ,
and produce a literal
.Sy % .
.
.Ss Note
The day of a command's execution can be specified by two
fields \(em day-of-month and day-of-week.
If both fields are restricted
.Pq i.e., aren't Sy * ,
the command will be run when
.Em either
field matches the current time.
For example,
.Dl  30 4 1,15 * 5 command
would run
.Va command
at 4:30 am on the 1st and 15th of each month, plus every Friday.
One can, however, achieve the desired result
by adding a test to the command
.Pq see the last example in Sx EXAMPLES , User's crontab No below .
.Pp
Instead of the first five fields, one of eight special strings may appear:
.TS
l   l  l l
lw5 lb l lb .
	string	meaning	equivalent
	_	_	_
	@reboot	Run once, at startup	\fR(none)\fP
	@yearly	Run once a year	0 0 1 1 *
	@annually	\^	\^
	@monthly	Run once a month	0 0 1 * *
	@weekly	Run once a week	0 0 * * 0
	@daily	Run once a day	0 0 * * *
	@midnight	\^	\^
	@hourly	Run once an hour	0 * * * *
.TE
.Pp
Please note that startup, as far as
.Sy @reboot
is concerned,
may be before some system daemons,
or other facilities, were started.

Some extra settings can only be tweaked with
.Dl Nm systemctl Cm edit Li cron- Ns Va schedule Ns Li .\& Ns Brq Li timer,service
.
.Sh LIMITATIONS
The
.Nm
syntax does not make it possible to define all possible periods one could imagine.
For example, it is not straightforward to define the last weekday of a month.
If a task needs to be run in a specific period of time that cannot be represented in a
.Nm ,
the best approach would be to have the job itself check the
date and time information and continue execution only if the current time
matches the desired one.
.Pp
.Xr systemd-crontab-generator 8
doesn't support the following Vixie Cron features:
.Bl -bullet -compact -width 0
.It
spawning forking daemons, the
.Xr systemd.service 5
units are all configured with
.Sy Type=oneshot
.
.It
Vixie Cron requires that each
.Nm
entry end in a new-line.
If the last entry in a crontab is missing a new-line,
Vixie Cron will consider it (at least partially) broken.
.Xr systemd-crontab-generator 8
considers this crontab valid.
.
.It
The parsing of quoting of environment variable
.Va value Ns s
depends on Vixie Cron distributor and vintage;
in non-error cases, behaviour described herein (removing quote pairs while possible) agrees with Debian bookworm's.
.
.It
An unpaired outer-most quote
.Pq Sy VAR=" , VAR="whatever" '
induces a parse error in Vixie Cron.
.Xr systemd-crontab-generator 8 ,
seeing no pairs, simply stops processing.
.
.It
systemd-cron since v1.16 (2023-07-10) but before v2.6.0 (2025-09-11) dequoted
.Va value Ns s
by stripping white-space from both sides,
then removing initial and terminal
.Sy ' Ns s ,
then removing initial and terminal
.Sy \&" Ns s ,
then removing initial and terminal spaces
.Pq So " " Sc Ns s .
This naturally meant it was impossible to have a
.Va value
with terminal or initial spaces.
.br
systemd-cron before v1.4.0 (2014-11-04) hadn't processed quotes at all, and between v1.4.0 and 1.16 didn't run the space removal step.
.El
.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
You can see how your crontab was translated by running
.Dl Nm systemctl Cm cat Li cron- Ns Va username Ns Li -*
(though completion may be more convenient).
