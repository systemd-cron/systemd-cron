v1.5.6 : 2017-01-10

     * fix last off-by-one error in processing of <n>-<m> ranges.

v1.5.5 : 2017-01-10

     * pass $(CPPFLAGS) to compilator for setgid helper
     * almost always generate .sh scripts to avoid that systemd
       complains with "Invalid escape sequences in line, correcting:"
       when parsing some complex one-liners
       https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/master/src/basic/extract-word.c#L204
     * fix off-by-one error in processing of '*/<n>' for months & days. Issue #49

v1.5.4 : 2016-01-29

     * generator: don't call OnFailure unit without a MTA avalaible.
     * sync with systemd-cron-next: remove --stale-stamps configure option
     * quote "Environment=" keypairs only when necessary

v1.5.3 : 2015-02-16

   Minor bugfixes:
     * add crontab --show option that lists crontabs
     * crontab: try /usr/bin/editor, /usr/bin/vim, /usr/bin/nano,
       /usr/bin/mcedit if VISUAL and EDITOR are not set
     * avoid forgeting successful edits in /tmp/

v1.5.2 : 2014-12-21

   Bug-fix release:
     * generator now process UTF-8 files correctly (generators are run
       with LANG=C)
     * global exception handler added to generator; now prints error in
       journal
     * make install : setgid helper will be chgrp cron / chmod 2755 if
       group cron exists ; but won't create this group by itself
     * now support BATCH=yes|no into crontabs; this is translasted into
       CPUSchedulingPolicy=idle & IOSchedulingClass=idle
     * the generator can now co-exist with a boilerplate /etc/crontab that
       does includes include definitions for /etc/cron.daily etc... these
       will only be processed if the matching native unit is not activated
       during configure step

v1.5.1 : 2014-12-13

     * make all writes in crontab (both Python & C parts) atomic
     * keep rejected crontabs in /tmp/crontab* for review
     * added support for /etc.cron.allow and /etc/cron.deny; without any
       of those, only root can create crontabs
     * turn the setuid/root helper into a setguid/crontab to let it run
       with the least privieges

   If you enable this feature in your package, some additional setup is
   needed after it has been unpacked:
      getent group crontab > /dev/null 2>&1 || addgroup --system crontab
      chgrp crontab /lib/systemd-cron/crontab_setgid
      chmod 2755 /lib/systemd-cron/crontab_setgid
      mkdir -p /var/spool/cron/crontabs
      chown root:crontab /var/spool/cron/crontabs
      chmod 1730 /var/spool/cron/crontabs
      cd /var/spool/cron/crontabs
      ls -1 | xargs -r -n 1 --replace=xxx  chown 'xxx:crontab' 'xxx'
      ls -1 | xargs -r -n 1 chmod 600

   The crontab program, when run as root, will also try to fixup file
   permissions;
   but won't create the crontab group.

   You can use sudo crontab -l -u $USER to fix-up your own crontab's
   permissions.

   THANKS to Lorenzo Beretta for review

v1.5.0 : 2014-12-11

     * added an optional C setuid helper to let non-root users use crontab

v1.4.2 : 2014-11-25

   Bug-Fix release
     * build now honor bindir for systemctl location
     * generator: better handling of quoted commands in crontabs

v1.4.1 : 2014-11-11

     * generator: will now log warnings & errors about bad crontabs in the
       journal
     * generator: try less aggressively to make jobs persistent: a job
       like 0 19 * * * root poweroff on a school/office PC would had run
       the next morning; which is not the expected behaviour; this can now
       be overiden with the PERSISTENT=yes|auto|no variable
     * new trivial internal utility boot_delay : this is needed
       because combining OnCalendar= & OnBootSec= in timer units doesn't
       have the needed behaviour (OR instead of AND). A boot delay is a
       standard feature of anacrontab; but can now also be used in crontab
       by specifying the DELAY= value.

   Thanks to @wavexx for the extensive review.

v1.4.0 : 2014-11-04

     * new utility mail_on_failure that is called by a new OnFailure=
       hook, both for static & generated units
     * add support for new time unit introduced in systemd 217: minutely,
       quarterly, semi-annually
     * review of man pages

v1.3.3 : 2014-10-21

   This release solves a bug introduced in crontab with the switch to
   Python3

v1.3.2 : 2014-10-20

     * switch to Python3 for crontab & generator
     * add a manpage for /etc/anacrontab
     * add a new utility remove_stale_stamps than removes stales stamps
       from long deleted crontabs ( It can be called from
       /etc/cron.weekly/ )
     * configure: statedir defaults now to '/var/spool/cron'
     * crontab: improved error handling
     * generator: add support for RANDOM_DELAY & START_HOURS_RANGE to
       anacrontab. This works in crontabs too.

v1.3.1 : 2014-09-22

     * turn Path watching unit in static unit
     * make Persistent=true smarter
     * make /var/spool configurable

     * Only activate service units if corresponding cron directory is
       non-empty.
