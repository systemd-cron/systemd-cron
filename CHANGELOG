v2.0.1 : 2023-08-22

   [наб & Dwayne Bent]
   * Improvements to the ./configure & Makefile.in

v2.0 : 2023-08-16

   [наб]
   * rewrite of the generator and crontab utility in C++
     which gives a lot more performance

   * rewrite mail_on_failure in Shell
   * drop dependency on Python
   * again majors improvements in the configure/Makefile scripts
   * support for timezones with TZ= environment variable,
     this requires systemd 235
   * an extensive testsuite (#51)

   [adetiste]
   * rewrite remove_stale_stamps in Shell; take into account
     the new "run-part-less" mode introduced in v1.5.15
   * use pkgconf to get systemd $unitdir & $generatordir

v1.16.7 : 2023-08-13

   * THIS IS THE LAST VERSION BEFORE MERGING THE C++ REWRITE

   * after a survey of downstream users,
     "cron-yearly.{service|timer}" are now enabled by default.
     This can be disabled again with an ./configure option.
   * run-part-less-mode: read base starting hour
     of daily/weeky/monthly jobs from distro's /etc/crontab
     if present

   [наб <nabijaczleweli@nabijaczleweli.xyz>]
   * fix more regressions found since the 1.16 OO-rewrite
   * review crontab_setgid.c

v1.16.7 : 2023-08-13

   * discarded version

v1.16.5 : 2023-08-09

   * fix another test failure on Debian build machines
     that are not yet UsrMerge'd.

v1.16.4 : 2023-08-09

   * fix test failure: "module 'importlib' has no attribute 'util'",
     may even impact 'crontab' CLI.
     This is a regression introduced by:
     "Python 3.12+ compatibility: "load_module()" was deprecated"

v1.16.3 : 2023-07-29

   * ignore /etc/cron.{hourly|daily|weekly|monthly}/0anacron.
     These files are present when anacron has not been fully removed,
     and do absolutely nothing (status "removed & non-purged" on Debian).
     /etc/cron.d/anacron would already be masked by empty anacron.service
   * monitor the contents of /etc/cron.{hourly|daily|weekly|monthly}/
     in run-parts-less mode.
   * make the build respect `libexecdir` configure variable
     https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Directory-Variables.html
     https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/ch04s07.html
   * UsrMerge: drop `runparts` configure variable,
               run-parts is now always /usr/bin/run-parts

   [наб <nabijaczleweli@nabijaczleweli.xyz>]

   * fix a syntax error in the crontab utility

v1.16 : 2023-07-10

   * major rewrite
   * MAILTO= : /etc/cron.*/ will inherit this from
               /etc/crontab if they don't provide their own
   * always explicitely set `User=root`, this way systemd will itself
     provide fallback for HOME=, LOGNAME=, USER= & SHELL= env. variables.
     (issue #65)
   * accept a days-of-week range that ends with '...-7' (#57)

v1.15.22 : 2023-07-04

     making parse_time_unit() even harder to understand

v1.5.6 : 2017-01-10

   * fix last off-by-one error in processing of <n>-<m> ranges.

v1.5.5 : 2017-01-10

   * pass $(CPPFLAGS) to compilator for setgid helper
   * almost always generate .sh scripts to avoid that systemd
     complains with "Invalid escape sequences in line, correcting:"
     when parsing some complex one-liners
     https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/master/src/basic/extract-word.c#L204
   * fix off-by-one error in processing of '*/<n>' for months & days. Issue #49

   * avoid forgeting successful edits in /tmp/

v1.5.2 : 2014-12-21

   Bug-fix release:
   * generator now process UTF-8 files correctly (generators are run
     with LANG=C)
   * global exception handler added to generator; now prints error in
     journal
   * make install : setgid helper will be chgrp cron / chmod 2755 if
     group cron exists ; but won't create this group by itself
   * now support BATCH=yes|no into crontabs; this is translasted into
     CPUSchedulingPolicy=idle & IOSchedulingClass=idle
   * the generator can now co-exist with a boilerplate /etc/crontab that
     does includes include definitions for /etc/cron.daily etc... these
     will only be processed if the matching native unit is not activated
     during configure step

v1.5.1 : 2014-12-13

  * make all writes in crontab (both Python & C parts) atomic
  * keep rejected crontabs in /tmp/crontab* for review
  * added support for /etc.cron.allow and /etc/cron.deny; without any
    of those, only root can create crontabs
  * turn the setuid/root helper into a setguid/crontab to let it run
    with the least privieges

   If you enable this feature in your package, some additional setup is
   needed after it has been unpacked:
      getent group crontab > /dev/null 2>&1 || addgroup --system crontab
      chgrp crontab /lib/systemd-cron/crontab_setgid
      chmod 2755 /lib/systemd-cron/crontab_setgid
      mkdir -p /var/spool/cron/crontabs
      chown root:crontab /var/spool/cron/crontabs
      chmod 1730 /var/spool/cron/crontabs
      cd /var/spool/cron/crontabs
      ls -1 | xargs -r -n 1 --replace=xxx  chown 'xxx:crontab' 'xxx'
      ls -1 | xargs -r -n 1 chmod 600

   The crontab program, when run as root, will also try to fixup file
   permissions;
   but won't create the crontab group.

   You can use sudo crontab -l -u $USER to fix-up your own crontab's
   permissions.

   THANKS to Lorenzo Beretta for review

v1.5.0 : 2014-12-11

   * added an optional C setuid helper to let non-root users use crontab

v1.4.2 : 2014-11-25

   Bug-Fix release
   * build now honor bindir for systemctl location
   * generator: better handling of quoted commands in crontabs

v1.4.1 : 2014-11-11

   * generator: will now log warnings & errors about bad crontabs in the
     journal
   * generator: try less aggressively to make jobs persistent: a job
     like 0 19 * * * root poweroff on a school/office PC would had run
     the next morning; which is not the expected behaviour; this can now
     be overiden with the PERSISTENT=yes|auto|no variable
   * new trivial internal utility boot_delay : this is needed
     because combining OnCalendar= & OnBootSec= in timer units doesn't
     have the needed behaviour (OR instead of AND). A boot delay is a
     standard feature of anacrontab; but can now also be used in crontab
     by specifying the DELAY= value.

   Thanks to @wavexx for the extensive review.

v1.4.0 : 2014-11-04

   * new utility mail_on_failure that is called by a new OnFailure=
     hook, both for static & generated units
   * add support for new time unit introduced in systemd 217: minutely,
     quarterly, semi-annually
   * review of man pages

v1.3.3 : 2014-10-21

   This release solves a bug introduced in crontab with the switch to
   Python3

v1.3.2 : 2014-10-20

   * switch to Python3 for crontab & generator
   * add a manpage for /etc/anacrontab
   * add a new utility remove_stale_stamps than removes stales stamps
     from long deleted crontabs ( It can be called from
     /etc/cron.weekly/ )
   * configure: statedir defaults now to '/var/spool/cron'
   * crontab: improved error handling
   * generator: add support for RANDOM_DELAY & START_HOURS_RANGE to
     anacrontab. This works in crontabs too.

v1.3.1 : 2014-09-22

   * turn Path watching unit in static unit
   * make Persistent=true smarter
   * make /var/spool configurable

v1.1.1 : 2013-07-31

   * Only activate service units if corresponding cron directory is
       non-empty.
   * Makefile does not automatically install cron directories.
